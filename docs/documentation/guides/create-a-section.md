A section in Nacara helps you organize your website. For example, you can have the following sections:

- **Documentation**: a place to host your project documentation
- **Blog**: a place to publish blog posts

## Create a new section

A section, is defined by creating a folder right under your source folder (default is `docsrc`).

If have this structure:

```
docsrc
├── blog
└── documentation
```

This means that you have two sections called `documentation` and `blog`.
